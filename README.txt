== Description ==

Introducing the Friend Referral System â€“ the ultimate solution designed to supercharge your e-commerce 
site with powerful referral capabilities. This plugin seamlessly integrates with WooCommerce, enabling you to 
leverage word-of-mouth marketing by rewarding your customers for referring friends and family.

This plugin can only be used with WooCommerce installed and requires an SMTP plugin for email functionality.

Features:
- Easy integration with any WooCommerce store.
- Automatically sends referral emails with coupon details.
- Rewards both the referrer and the referred friend with customizable coupons.
- The reward coupon for the sender is offered only after the referral friend places an order.
- Coupons usage is restricted to the email address used during the referral, with a default usage limit of one per coupon.
